## Description of Sprint
Before when an user logged out they were rerouted to the login page, but still had access to all the rest of the apps throught the tabs.
Disable tab view in login page so tabs wont show when user logs out and reappers when they log back in. Tried to get email verification to 
work however was still not completely successful. Was able to sent email with verification link to those who sign in using an email and password, however users can still get into the app with out verifing their email.
