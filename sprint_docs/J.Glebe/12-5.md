## Description of Sprint

(Sprint doc from 12/2-12/5) Added additional functionality in regards to pending friend requests at Sarah's request. Can now retrieve
the full infomation of all pending friends as a single object with a single function call. Also implemented a function to get a user by
id, just as a friendlier syntax for those who didn't like using subscripts on the users objects. VERY thoroughly documented everything
to help clarify various questions over the exact usage of my database provider's functions. Overall, relatively few functional changes
in this time frame, but several hours of tedious typing.
