## Description of Sprint

(Sprint doc from 12/6-12/12) I worked on the ability to upload tagged locations with images, names, and geopoints.
That's really it for this section. Testing devices for master branch and individual branches with their features.
Made android builds work again. Rewrote user creation to include additional information. Includes creation time (at
request of Messaging team) and id as well as just looking a little nicer.
